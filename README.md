# APCSP
 My  Final Project for APCSP

Project Description:
My project is a custom variation of TicTacToe where, instead of X and O battling each other, Elan and Umar battle each other.
The purpose of my project is to provide a fun game for people (especially those in our class) to play

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Home page with the instructions for hwo to play
- `game.html`: The actual game page where you play
- `styles.css`: All teh styling for the website
- `script.js`: Game logic and functionality, clicking, loading the pics etc
- `images/`: Folder containing custom X and O images (elan and umar)

## How to use
Just load the website, click play, and just click on the squares. regular TicTacToe rules
## Credits
- Game is inspired by basic TicTacToe like the one that I made with Bridegt for the AP project
- DeepSeek and ChatGPT and Duck used for specific things that I wanted assistance with, like how to program a thing if I didnt know how to or help with debugging or help with syntax etc
- Got a lot of help from Henry and other classmates with the code as well
